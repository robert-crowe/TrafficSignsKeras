This is an implementation in Keras on Tensorflow of a convolutional network classifier for the German Traffic Sign
dataset.  You'll need a copy of the dataset, which is available at:

The architecture is a fairly straghtforward CNN, using pooling and dropout.  For a more detailed
model in Tensorflow, see:
